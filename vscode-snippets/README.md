# VS Code Snippets #

This includes a custom snippets library for the Segments system.  To install:

- Locate your VS Code Editor's snippets file.

- You can either just replace the file with the included Segments `segments.code-snippets`, or if you already have modified the file with some of your own snippets, then you can copy and paste the contents of the included Segments `segments.code-snippets` into the VS Code Editor `segments.code-snippets` file on your machine.
